With the final puzzle solved, the chest is found empty—yet a hidden mechanism clicks into place.
Ancient gears grind, and the desert fog begins to lift.
As the dust clears, a grand colosseum emerges—its sunlit arches inviting the heroes onward.

A weary voice echoes from within the pyramid:
"Forgive me for conjuring this storm. I only wished to protect the oasis from... him."

Undeterred, the heroes advance.

"Ralos claims this oasis and it's treasures. Only those proven worthy may challenge its champion."

Despite the imposing figure before them, the heroes steel themselves for battle.

Sol Heredit rises, casting a long shadow across the arena.
"Very well. I shall test your strength myself!"

The crowd murmurs in anticipation as Sol Heredit leaps from his throne, landing with a force that shakes the arena floor.

Battling through a fierce blizzard, the heroes stumble upon a massive, ice-encrusted door etched with Zarosian runes.
Its surface is sealed tight, impervious to force or magic.

Surveying the area, they spot three mystical braziers positioned around the arena, each unlit and covered in frost.
Perhaps igniting these braziers will be enough to thaw out the ancient ice.

As the heroes near the chest at the heart of Zaros Sanctum, the temperature drops further, and an eerie silence falls over the chamber.
Suddenly, the ground trembles, and shards of ice explode from the floor.

Two crimson eyes glow in the dark, and from the frozen mist, Nex emerges—wings spread wide.

"You dare enter my sanctum?" Her voice is a chilling whisper that echoes through the chamber.
"To claim the treasure you seek, you must first prove your worth... by defeating me."

With Nex vanquished, a surge of Wrath magic erupts, tearing the ground asunder and casting the heroes into a swirling abyss.
