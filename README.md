### Key Design Patterns

#### Command Pattern Implementation
```python
# Clean separation of concerns in cog architecture
class PlayerCog(commands.Cog):
    @app_commands.command(name="submit")
    async def submit(self, interaction, option: int, image: discord.Attachment):
        # Handles complex submission logic with state validation
```

#### Observer Pattern for Real-Time Updates
```python
# Auto-updating leaderboard with 3-minute refresh cycle
@tasks.loop(minutes=3)
async def update_leaderboard(self):
    # Fetches latest team data and updates Discord embed
```

#### Factory Pattern for Dynamic Content
```python
# Dynamic embed generation based on game state
def get_embed_for_board(self, team_data: Dict, board_info: Dict):
    # Returns appropriate embed type based on world and game state
```

### Database Schema
```javascript
// Team Document Structure
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  team_name: String,
  discord_channel_id: String,
  players: [Player],
  current_world: Number,
  current_tile: Number,
  game_state: Number, // 0=overworld, 1=key, 2=boss
  completion_counter: Number,
  last_rolled_at: Date,
  // World-specific progression data
  w1_shuffled_tiles: [Number],
  w2_path_chosen: Number,
  w3_braziers_lit: Number,
  // ... extensive state tracking
}
```
