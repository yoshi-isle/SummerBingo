The heroes arrive at a strange, forgotten island—drawn by whispers of treasure and glory.
They step off their boat, boots sinking into wet sand... only to be greeted by a mob of snippy sand crabs.
From somewhere deep inland, a voice echoes across the map:
"Come forward.."
Little do they know the perils that await them... hidden behind every tile.

As the adventurers ascend to the mountain's peak, the air grows still.
Suddenly, two massive claws crash down before them, shaking the earth with a deafening roar.
The ground quakes beneath their feet—The Great Olm has arrived.

A voice—ancient and cold—rattles their bones:
"To defeat me... you must claim that which is most rare."

Under the blazing sun, the heroes journey deeper into the shifting sands, each step swallowed by the desert's fury.
A violent sandstorm whips around them, blurring the horizon and testing their determination.

Through the swirling dust, the outline of a grand pyramid appears—its entrance aglow with ancient energy.
A powerful voice echoes from within:
"Face the trials of Tumeken, and the storm shall part."

What secrets await beyond the storm?

With the final puzzle solved, ancient gears grind and the desert fog begins to thin.
Beyond the clearing dust, a vast colosseum rises—its sunlit arches beckoning the heroes onward.

A heavy door swings open, revealing the way ahead.

The heroes step into the grand colosseum, its sunlit arches casting long shadows across the shifting sands.
At the center, seated upon a throne of gilded stone, awaits Sol Heredit—Champion of Ralos—his golden armor radiant beneath the desert sky.

He regards the adventurers with a measured gaze, his voice echoing through the arena:
"You seek the treasure of Tumeken's Oasis, yet this domain now answers to Varlamore. Our banners claim new ground with every sunrise, and these sands are the latest prize."

The heroes are intimidated by Sol Heredit's presence, yet they stand their ground.

Rising to his feet, Sol Heredit gestures to the vast arena:
"Fine then, I'll face you myself!"

The audience of the colosseum looks on, their anticipation palpable. Sol Heredit jumps from his throne, landing with a thud that shakes the ground beneath the heroes' feet.

The cold bites harder with each step as the heroes scale the frozen expanse of Zaros Plateau.
Once a fortress of the god of control, now a shattered land cloaked in snow and silence.
Frozen bones litter the trail, and howling winds whisper secrets from a time long past.
Through the blizzard, a voice calls out—sharp and distant:
"Step forward, if you dare disturb her slumber..."

    W3_KEY = '''
Inside a long-abandoned temple, half-buried in frost, lies a shard of Zarosian power.
It flickers with a strange energy, locked behind a wall of ancient, arcane ice.
As the heroes approach, runes ignite and the floor rumbles beneath them.
A voice, void of warmth, speaks:
"Three of five challenges must be conquered... only then shall the ice yield."

A blood-red moon looms overhead as the heroes cross into Drakan's Void.
The land itself is twisted—withered trees, whispering fog, and rivers that run unnaturally dark.
Every step forward feels watched. Every breath—heavy.

A voice hisses from the shadows:
"Welcome, little lambs... the feast begins soon."

This is no longer a quest for glory. It is survival.

In the depths of a ruined cathedral, drenched in shadows, a black altar pulses with cursed energy.
Above it floats a key, wrapped in chains of sinew and bone.

A rasping voice fills the chamber:
"Complete three of five trials... or become part of my collection."

A blood-curdling scream echoes through the void as the skies turn black and the moon disappears.

From a swirl of shadow and smoke, Lord Drakan emerges—towering, ageless, and hungry.  
Crimson eyes pierce the gloom. His voice drips with venom:

"To face me, you must offer the rarest of spoils... a sacred treasure from the Theatre itself."

The air thickens. The void pulses. The final battle is upon them.

    W4_END = '''
With Drakan defeated and the final reward claimed, the island begins to tremble.

A distant rumble echoes beneath the ground—**not of collapse… but awakening.**

The heroes regroup at the shoreline, battered but victorious. As they board their ship, a strange figure watches from the cliffs above—hooded, unmoving.

A final whisper rides the wind:

**"You've only scratched the surface..."**
