The heroes arrive at a strange, forgotten island—drawn by whispers of treasure and glory.
They step off their boat, boots sinking into wet sand... only to be greeted by a mob of snippy sand crabs.
From somewhere deep inland, a voice echoes across the map:
"Come forward.."
Little do they know the perils that await them... hidden behind every tile.

As the adventurers ascend to the mountain's peak, the air grows still.
Suddenly, two massive claws crash down before them, shaking the earth with a deafening roar.
The ground quakes beneath their feet—The Great Olm has arrived.

A voice—ancient and cold—rattles their bones:
"To defeat me... you must claim that which is most rare."

        "dialogue": '''
The blazing sun beats down as the heroes cross the shifting sands of Tumeken's Oasis.
Golden scarabs skitter underfoot as they march forward, mirages dancing on the horizon.
A warm wind carries a voice, playful and mocking:
"Come find me, if you thirst for power..."
'''}

    W2_KEY = '''
Within a half-buried pyramid, the adventurers discover a radiant relic—glowing with divine energy.
But between them and their prize lie deadly traps, ancient curses, and puzzles untouched for centuries.
As sand spills from the walls, a voice booms from above:
"Only those who endure the trials of Tumeken may continue. Complete three of five challenges to proceed."

The door groans open, revealing the path forward.
'''

    W2_BOSS = '''
At the heart of the colosseum, beneath the ever-burning sun, the sand trembles.
A thunderous crack splits the arena floor as a massive figure emerges—Sol Heredit, Champion of Ralos.

His voice echoes with divine authority:
"To prove your worth... bring me Ralos, the rarest gift of the sands."

The crowd of spirits watches in silence. The battle begins.

    W3_START = {
        "title": "Chapter 3: Cold Rush",
        "dialogue": '''
The cold bites harder with each step as the heroes scale the frozen expanse of Zaros Plateau.
Once a fortress of the god of control, now a shattered land cloaked in snow and silence.
Frozen bones litter the trail, and howling winds whisper secrets from a time long past.
Through the blizzard, a voice calls out—sharp and distant:
"Step forward, if you dare disturb her slumber..."
'''
    }
    W3_KEY = '''
Inside a long-abandoned temple, half-buried in frost, lies a shard of Zarosian power.
It flickers with a strange energy, locked behind a wall of ancient, arcane ice.
As the heroes approach, runes ignite and the floor rumbles beneath them.
A voice, void of warmth, speaks:
"Three of five challenges must be conquered... only then shall the ice yield."
'''

    W3_BOSS = '''
The blizzard dies suddenly, and an eerie silence falls over the Zarosian sanctum.
Two crimson eyes glow in the dark, and from the frozen mist, Nex emerges—wings spread wide.

Her voice is chilling:
"Fate binds us here... bring me the blade born of courage—ZCB, forged from nothing."
'''

    W4_START = {
        "title": "Chapter 4: Endgame",
        "dialogue": '''
A blood-red moon looms overhead as the heroes cross into Drakan's Void.
The land itself is twisted—withered trees, whispering fog, and rivers that run unnaturally dark.
Every step forward feels watched. Every breath—heavy.

A voice hisses from the shadows:
"Welcome, little lambs... the feast begins soon."

This is no longer a quest for glory. It is survival.
'''
    }
    W4_KEY = '''
In the depths of a ruined cathedral, drenched in shadows, a black altar pulses with cursed energy.
Above it floats a key, wrapped in chains of sinew and bone.

A rasping voice fills the chamber:
"Complete three of five trials... or become part of my collection."
'''

    W4_BOSS = '''
A blood-curdling scream echoes through the void as the skies turn black and the moon disappears.

From a swirl of shadow and smoke, Lord Drakan emerges—towering, ageless, and hungry.  
Crimson eyes pierce the gloom. His voice drips with venom:

"To face me, you must offer the rarest of spoils... a sacred treasure from the Theatre itself."

The air thickens. The void pulses. The final battle is upon them.
'''

    W4_END = '''
With Drakan defeated and the final reward claimed, the island begins to tremble.

A distant rumble echoes beneath the ground—**not of collapse… but awakening.**

The heroes regroup at the shoreline, battered but victorious. As they board their ship, a strange figure watches from the cliffs above—hooded, unmoving.

A final whisper rides the wind:

**"You've only scratched the surface..."**
